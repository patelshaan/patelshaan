- 👋 Hi, I’m @patelshaan
- 👀 I’m interested in competitive programming, competitive Science Bowl, Science Fair, First Robotics, as well as anything and everything related to biology and math/informatics. I am the drumline captain at my school as well as an avid drumset player.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Pre-Calculus and general science bowl driven scientific knowledge as an 8th grader; I am fluent in Python coding, and I am learning Java and C++. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on topics related to my Science Fair projects (not including those under development, which you are welcome to reach out to me for more information about):
  Coral Computing: Using Machine Learning to predict coral mutations across generations.
I am willing to share anything you want to know including awards and experiences, and would love to hear anything (and everything) that you want to reach out to me about.
- 📫 How to reach me: At my Gmail: patelshaan9898@gmail.com
